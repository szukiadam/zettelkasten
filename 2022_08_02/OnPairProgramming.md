## Summary: 

1. How to pair
    1. Styles
        1. Driver and navigator
            1. driver
                1. writes code
                1. ignores larger issues
            1. navigator
                1. reviews the code on the go
                1. gives directions and shares thoughts
                1. has an eye for larger issues
        1. Ping-pong
            1. ping: developer A writes tests
            1. pong: developer B writes code to make test pass
            1. embraces TDD
            1. "Red-Green-Refactor"
        1. Strong-Style Pairing
            1. useful for knowledge transfer
            1. experienced navigator, novice driver (with language, tool, codebase)
            1. driver must be "comfortable with incomplete understanding" 
                1. questions of why and challenges should be discussed after the implementation session
            1. borders on micro-management
            1. useful onboarding tool
        1. Pair Development
            1. more of a mindset about pairing
            1. development of a user story consists of writing code and many other tasks
                1. as a pair, your responsibility is all the other tasks
    1. Pair rotations
        1. rotate pairs: one anchor stays, the other leaves, another person joins
        1. reasons
            1. avoid knowledge silos
            1. increase collective code ownership
            1. get some more code reviews on the go
    1. Things to avoid
        1. Drifting apart (don't look at your phone)
        1. Micro-management mode
        1. Impatience (apply the 5 seconds rule: wait at least 5 seconds before you say something)
        1. Keyboard Hogging
        1. Pairing 8 hours per day
1. Benefits
