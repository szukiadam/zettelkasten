## Summary: 

1. 6 broad model categories:
    1. traveller preferences models
    1. traveller contexts models
    1. item space navigation models 
    1. user interface optimisation (UI images, font size etc.)
    1. content curation models (e.g. which review to show)
    1. content augmentation models (e.g. how prices in the area are trending, great value options)

**Takeaways:**
1. projects introducing machine learning models deliver strong business value
    1. ML models deliver higher returns than other projects
1. model performance != business performance
    1. uncanny valley effect (=In this phenomenon, people feel a sense of unease or even revulsion in response to humanoid robots that are highly realistic.)
    > An interesting finding is that increasing the performance of a model does not necessarily translate into a gain in [business] value.
1. be clear about the problem you're trying to solve
    1. input: business case
    1. output: well-defined modeling problem (usually a supervised ML problem)
    > Some of the most powerful improvements come not from improving a model in the context of a given setup, but changing the setup itself.
    > In general we found that often the best problem is not the one that comes to mind immediately and that changing the set up is a very effective way to unlock value.
1. prediction serving latency matters
    > Booking.com found that an increase of about 30% in latency cost about 0.5% in conversion rates “a relevant cost for our business“.
1. get early feedback on model quality 
    1. it is crucial to monitor the quality of the new models
    1. Two challanges during this:
        1. incomplete feedback due to difficulty of observing true labels
        1. delayed feedback 
    1. Booking looked at the distribution of responses generated by the model
    > …Response Distribution Analysis has proved to be a very useful tool that allows us to detect defects in the models very early.
1. test the business impact of your models through randomised controlled trials
