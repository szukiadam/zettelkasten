## Summary: 

1. Majority
Smaller tech companies don't need their first data person to be a data engineer.
Go for purple people.
> First full time data hire needs to be obsessed with business impact.
1. Data Engineering
    1. DE: Software eng. + Data (required in tech businesses, not needed 99% of the time)
    1. DE: Solutions oriented + Data (needed when extracting and centralising data is critical for future important tasks)
    1. Tools oriented vs goal-oriented? (interesting point)
1. Business logic
1. Managed services
    1. Current tasks of OP: DW fine tuning, ELT troubleshooting, analytics, modeling
    1. Problem shifted from getting the data to **using the data**
1. Minority
    1. Data engineering in certain contexts is necessary, but likely to be a specialisation increasingly of interest to the minority.
    1. WHEN 
1. Implications and evidence from the field
    > Either you move in the direction of the new business problem.
    > Or you move to a new business that still has the old problem.
    > Or you specialise further until you find another domain to play in, and wait for the tide to turn again.

## My opinion: Summarizes the hotter articles in the past year pretty well, also well articulated poits.
