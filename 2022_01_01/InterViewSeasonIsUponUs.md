## Summary: 

1. Semi-objective hiring bars
>I’m trying to document evidence that the candidate knows enough about the topic in question. 
>For one thing, if someone expresses knowledge of stuff that is more advanced (and thus something not every candidate is likely to know, a.k.a, not appropriate to ask of every candidate), and I happen to know about that same topic, it gives us a chance to explore that more advanced topic instead.
>I do take the somewhat unorthodox step of flat out telling people up front what I’m trying to get out of them

1. Is this someone I wouldn't mind working with?
> For my part, I seem to get along with most people, so I’m primarily just keeping a careful eye for red flags to make note of.
    1. So, what can go wrong at interviews?
    > The most common problem seems to be when someone gets very stuck on something and spends a lot of precious time not providing any new information about themselves.
    > Another thing that could go wrong is that the interview is progressing fine and it’s slowly dawning on you that the person has applied to the incorrect job level.
    > the package of skills and experience a candidate brings just does not fit with the specific needs of the team right now.
