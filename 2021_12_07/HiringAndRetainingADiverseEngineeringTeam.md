## Longer 
> ‘There are two aspects that I think matter if you want a diverse team. The first is whether you can hire people. The second is whether you can keep them.
1. Sarah Wells
    1. Hiring
        1. Visible diversity
            >  I am more likely to believe your company is inclusive and that I will like the culture, if I can see people who look like me in leadership positions. 
        1. Job specs, make sure they are inclusive 
            >  Focus on collaboration and learning, rather than ‘crushing it’.
            > Run job descriptions past a range of people. Ask them, "is there anything here that would spook you?"
        1. Networking - Ask people to use their social media
        1. Don't assume everyone has lots of free time to spend completing a coding project. Some groups cannot afford to commit that much time into coding projects
        1. Make sure interviewers aren't all white men. 
            > You also want to avoid the few underrepresented people being 'the token interviewers' in an interview.
        1. Partner with organizations offering non-standard routes into coding.
    1. Retaining
        1. Stay inclusive and give opportunities to underrepresented people.
        1. Data is crucial 
            > We have since amended our HR systems to track other aspects of diversity. ... Explain why you are collecting this information because people will be suspicious.
        1. Use the data but do so intelligently
            > On our promotion boards, we look at the data to make sure we aren't biased in who gets a promotion or a pay rise. We compare the minimum, average and maximum for each grade.
        1. Measure what matters to you as an organisation.
            > ‘If you don't have any OKRs relating to culture, diversity and inclusion, you are sending a message to your teams that those things aren't important.
        1. Show diversity with everything you share.
        1. Training (for example on neurodiversity and mental health)
        1. Stand up for people
1. Samuel Adjei
    > ‘It’s easier to attract diverse talent if an organisation invests in seeking out “diverse” leaders.
    1. Be flexible
        1. Leave your bias at the door
        1. Know that they will be less experienced at interviewing.
        1. Create an interview environment that allows them to showcase their skills.
            > ‘Ask questions in ways that resonates with the candidate. No two candidates are the same. Use your emotional intelligence, as a leader.
        1. Evaluate each candidate as an individual over comparing. 
            > Focus on the only question that matters: all things being equal, does this person meet requirements for the job?
    1. Track what is working and what isn’t, but don’t put a number on it.
        > ‘I never set out to increase our diversity by a set percentage. I set out to increase our diversity, period. 
    1. Understand that improving diversity is a journey.
1. Franziska Hauck 
    1. Unconscious bias
        > ‘Recognize and question your own biases, consistently, at every opportunity. A good example is “meditating” about known biases before you enter the interview as a hiring manager. For example, ask yourself: 
        > “Am I hiring this person because I like them or because they’re qualified, or both? Why do I ascribe a lower technical acumen to women than to men?”
1. Uma Chingunde
    > ‘It’s a chicken-and-egg problem,’ Uma says. ‘To attract people of different backgrounds, you need to start with an inclusive and diverse team. How do you get here?
    > ‘The biggest pitfall of running structured processes is the friction it causes. Asking people to step up for an opportunity is time-consuming. It’s tempting to think “let me sidestep this process just this once, and pick David for this opportunity.” Whenever you find yourself in this position, take 15 minutes to be more conscious about picking people. Write down a list of candidates, why you’d pick them, and what they would gain from this opportunity. You won’t always be able to follow a structured approach, but aim to do this 90% of the time.’
1. Colin Howe
    1. Be more lenient at the screening stage for underrepresented people.
        >  ‘the screening stage is about minimising the chance of interviewing candidates that fail the interview. I'd happily absorb more risk and have more failures, if it means we see more people with non-traditional profiles.’
