## Summary: 
1. Lots of hard decisions in personal and professional life
    1. Choosing a netflix movie or a restaurant
    2. Planning a product roadmap
    3. Settling on a pricing model etc.
2. Often we turn data not for education but to back up our decisions. In this case, it acts as a substitute for courage. 
3. Analysts often hide in their data, but not every problem is quantifiable. 
4. Sometimes we need to say 
> We don't know and we are not going to know
5. Sometimes people need courage instead of opinion to make them feel comfortable and assured. 
> Without that courage, we’re just clever puppets, dancing to whatever tune our data sings to us, hoping nobody sees the wires we’re submitting to. To be real leaders, we have to prove ourselves brave enough to know when to walk on our own.
> But often, we turn to data for reasons other than education. In some instances, data is a rhetorical club and dishonest cover, a weapon for prosecuting your point, and a defense for protecting yourself as reasonable and impartial.
## My opinion:
Interesting read, which I mainly agree with. Also interesting to think about how many times someone tries to hide behind data. <br>
Most importantly, you should use analysis to guide your decision and realize when your decision is already set, but you do analysis to please this decision.
