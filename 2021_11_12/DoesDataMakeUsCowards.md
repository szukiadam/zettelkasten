## Summary: 
1. Lots of hard decisions in personal and professional life
    1. Choosing a netflix movie or a restaurant
    2. Planning a product roadmap
    3. Settling on a pricing model etc.
2. Often we turn data not for education but to back up our decisions. In this case, it acts as a substitute for courage. 
3. Analysts often hide in their data, but not every problem is quantifiable. 
4. Sometimes we need to say 
> We don't know and we are not going to know
5. Sometimes people need courage instead of opinion to make them feel comfortabl and assured. 
> Without that courage, we’re just clever puppets, dancing to whatever tune our data sings to us, hoping nobody sees the wires we’re submitting to. To be real leaders, we have to prove ourselves brave enough to know when to walk on our own.
