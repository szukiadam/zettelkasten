- Grow your people above all as a manager
- Builds an environment that empowers the growth
    - motivating, ambitious, fast-moving and there is a sense of urgency
    - match personal growth paths with the team roadmap
    - fast-moving and sense of urgency: lots of opportunities for the team which are grabbed early
- Personal goals for every team member
    - put ambitious goals on each team member
    - goals should be crafted individually, but empowering the whole team
    - goals shouldn't be binary: no price for reaching them, no punishment for missing them -> **Only the journey matters.**
- Goals should be independent of KPIs
    - focus on levelling up your people's skills
- How to set up goals for engineers?
    - start with the job spec: what are the skills and behaviours that level them up
    - most impactful for your team in the near future
    - provide level-up opportunities and make quantitative metrics to track their success
- Examples of good goals
    - involvement in tech design to empower their tech leadership
    - code reviews to help them share strong opinions
    - running learning sessions to grow their mentoring skills
    - delegated projects to increase their independence and leadership
    - proposing product changes to improve their product awareness
    - improving team processes for their communication skills
- Bad goals
    - all binary ones -> delivery project XYZ (more of a KPI)
    - scoped to the engineer only -> read a book, do a course
