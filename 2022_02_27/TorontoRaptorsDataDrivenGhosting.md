# Title: TorontoRaptorsDataDrivenGhosting
## Source: http://grantland.com/features/the-toronto-raptors-sportvu-cameras-nba-analytical-revolution/ 
## Summary: 

1. SportVU was used to record every movement on the floor
1. It took a long time to build a program that creates a video file from the tracked X-Y coordinates
1. The ghosts are always more aggressive than the real players
1. Analytics like this can drive conversation: should you just jack 3s or settle for high percentage midrange shots?
1. By relying too much on analytics, you are **valuing results over culture** (however it should the other way around)

## My opinion: Interesting read, didn't know this already existed. Must've taken a lot of time though.
