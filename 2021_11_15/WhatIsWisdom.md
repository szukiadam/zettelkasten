## Summary:
Some quotes:

1. What evolutions tells us 
    1. example of animals: would you rather be violent or non-violent? optimal is 60%-40%, called *evolutionary stable strategies*
    1. same for humans: extraverted vs introverted - it's better that society is mixed
    1. Temple Grandin says, "The world needs all kinds of minds." -> 100% true for teams in organizations as well, aim for diversity 
2. The genius of Democracy 
    1. democratic societies tend to be more economically innovative, culturally dynamic, and physically safer than the alternatives. (and that's why tyranny fails)
3. The price for diversity
    1. the price for diversity is constant stress and anxiety. Diversity means differences and differences mean conflict
    > Yet this perception that everyone else is awful is evidence that everything is alright.
4. A wise mind
    > It’s the ability to allow a diversity of values and thoughts to emerge within your own mind, yet still be able to act despite them.
    1. The fact that we’re exposed to enough diversity of thought and lifestyle to be so annoyed by everyone demonstrates that the system is working. In a sense, democracy requires constant dissatisfaction. It’s not a bug, it's a feature. 
    1. A wise person’s mind is like a democracy, but it's good. It's **wisdom**. This is understanding trade-offs and consequences and accountability.
    1. .. the goal isn’t to quieten or relieve yourself of your internal discord, it’s to learn to live with it. 


## My opinion: 
Interesting read, especially the facts in the first part. Probably true, but wouldn't it be easier if we weren't exposed to the things that annoy us? How would that impact our behaviour, if at all?
