## Summary: 

1. Always use CTEs - makes queries easier to write and maintain
2. Keep CTEs small and single purpose - one CTE, one responsibility
3. DRY
4. Don't tangle dependency chains - Make sure your joins are at the same layer 
5. Reduce data before joining
6. Only select the columns you need
7. Expect the unexpected - NULLs, missing data, duplicate rows, random values
8. Start with a left join - You can never be sure an inner join will work as you intend it to
