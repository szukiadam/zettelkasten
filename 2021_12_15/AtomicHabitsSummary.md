1. Massive actions vs 1% improvements
    1. Usually the tiny improvements create the incredible change

    1. Atomic habits are the building blocks of the great results
1. Three layers of behavioural change

    1. Stacking habits: "After [current habit], I will [new habit]"
    1. Environment vs motivation
        1. We are more influenced by our environment than by our motivation
        1. Environment shapes your behaviour
        1. Context is the cue
        1. Imagine your environment as relationships with objects
        1. Try to make separate zones in your house. "One space, one use"

    1. Where cravings come from
        1. Underlying motives
        > "Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of the old vices, the underlying motives behind human behaviour remain the same. - James Clear"

1. Most important rule
    1. "This feel good"
    > "What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. - James Clear"
1. Mismatch between immediate result and outcome is important
    1. Usually bad habits have "happy" immediate results and "unhappy" outcomes, good habits vice-versa
    1. Try to add something to the good habits to make immediate pleasure 
1. Rewarding yourself and feeling successful
    1. Visual measurements are really useful
1. Habit tracking
