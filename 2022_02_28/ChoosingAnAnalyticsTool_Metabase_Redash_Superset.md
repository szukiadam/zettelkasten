## Summary: 

1. Deployment: Superset > Metabase > Redash (Kubernetes + Helm focus)
1. AWS Athena is a distributed query service, it's useful when it comes to querying data lakes.
1. Data sources: Redash > Superset > Metabase (AWS Athena focus)
1. Alerting and reporting: Metabase >Redash > Superset (Slack integration focus)

> Out of the three tools the least mature one seems to be Redash. What drove the choice for us between Metabase and Superset was the ability to easily share queries through the tool, the intuitive UX and rich dashboarding experience. As such we’ve decided to give Metabase a proper go and will be trying it out in production. In future articles we’ll explore our experience with the tool.
