# Title: OpenSourceIsNotAboutYou
## Source: https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9
## Summary: 

1. Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism, period.
1. Decisions should be those of the 'product owners', not the community
1. Conservative approach

## My opinion: 

Contradictionary writing, but makes a lot of sense
