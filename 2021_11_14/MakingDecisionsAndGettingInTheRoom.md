## Summary: 
1. Chart of roadmap/stakeholder death cycle -> "The research (=data) death cycle" 
2. DAs need to eavesdrop and interrupt. 
3. During meetings look for unchallenged assumptions and unsolved customer mysteries and then volunteer to research those questions.
4. Create value by finding new information / insight that can change minds. 
5. "Get into the room" when decision making is not data-driven
6. If DAs need to "eavesdrop and interrupt", something is probably wrong in your organization.
