## Summary: 
1. Scale of Systems people - KPI people (DE, AE, DA, DS, MLE)
2. Prioritization is important
> If you’re a Systems Person constantly evaluate how your work impacts downstream consumers (🖇), how many consumers you have (🎳) and how much time you spend (⌛️).
3. Example: a data engineer will have greater ROI on their time from improving the performance of the data platform because this platform supports every other data team member
> Data Scientists and Data Analysts work faster if they have high quality data and good data models. Analytics [Engineers] and Data Engineers have multitudes of impact if their data models are used by many.
4. Remember that everyone plays a role. 
5. ROI = ImpactedDataPeople x ImpactedDataPeople(MeasureOfImpact) x BusinessImpact - TimeSpent
6. Systems people (DE, AE, DA)
    1. Focus on increasing number of consumers (the more people use your data the better)
    2. Build high quality systems
7. KPI People (DA, DS, MLE)
    1. Reduce number of degrees between you and top-line KPI (be as close to the product as you can)
    2. Move fast and iterate

> If you find yourself working in a data role where it’s often hard to gauge what the impact of your work is and the number of data consumers that benefit from your work is low think about if you’re working on the most impactful problems
