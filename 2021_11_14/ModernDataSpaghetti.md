## Summary: 
1. Being a successful DA is hard, because
    1. You are measured by the speed with which you deliver insights
    2. Data is constantly changing as you are trying to do your job
    3. It's your responsibility to know whether the data is correctly represented or not
2. Lot's of tools -> lots of integration problems 
3. Few possible paths to solve this issue
    1. The data mesh - split the complexity into vertical pillars
    2. The data fabric (one API, one vendor, one bill)
    3. Open source data OS - the open source data OS, in which we resolve this complexity through open standards and shared protocols that enable different tools in the modern data stack to talk to one another.
4. Obviously the data OS is the most convenient solution for all DAs, but is it possible?
