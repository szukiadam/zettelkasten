## Summary: Previous big waves in data infrastructure failed to live up to their potential. Is the modern data stack any different?

1. MDS is fundamentally a new generation of **infrastructure**
1. Infrastructure becomes more critical as **more and more things are built on top of it**
1. Question is, what will be built on top of this infrastructure:
    1. Pervasive analytics
    > With this new infrastructure, weâ€™ve mostly rebuilt existing analytical experiences on top of it. This is typical with infrastructure shifts: first the industry rebuilds known experiences, then eventually shifts into building fundamentally new things.
    1. Data science / ML: will the data science and analytics worlds start to blend together?
    1. Application development: To what extent will the modern data stack move from being primarily focused on internal analytics to being a target for application development?
